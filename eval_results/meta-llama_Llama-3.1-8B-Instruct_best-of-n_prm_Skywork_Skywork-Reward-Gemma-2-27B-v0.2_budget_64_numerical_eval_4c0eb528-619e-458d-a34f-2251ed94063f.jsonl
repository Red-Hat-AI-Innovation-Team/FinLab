Since SG&A expenses are a component of operating expenses, an increase in SG&A expenses would likely negatively impact the operating margin. The operating margin is a metric that represents the percentage of revenue left after deducting operating expenses, including SG&A, from sales revenue. Therefore, if SG&A expenses increase, the operating margin would decrease.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nThe increase in SG&A expenses driven by various charges and costs primarily related to litigation, exiting manufacturing and markets, and investments in growth initiatives negatively impacted the operating margin as of FY2022 for 3M.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that operating margin may not be a useful metric for a company like 3M in this context, because the significant charges and costs that impacted SG&A can be one-time or non-recurring in nature.

This suggests that the Xilinx acquisition had a significant impact on AMD's financials in 2022, specifically affecting operating income. Operating margin, which is calculated by dividing operating income by revenue, would also be affected by this decrease in operating income.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nGiven the provided context, the Xilinx acquisition and associated amortization of intangible assets is the reason for the change in operating income, which in turn affects operating margin. Operating margin is a useful metric for companies like AMD as it provides insight into their operational efficiency.

However, the given data doesn't include the Total revenues net of interest expense.

To determine if Corning has positive working capital based on FY2022 data, we need to calculate the working capital.\n\nWorking Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities\n= $7,453 million - $5,175 million\n= $2,278 million\n\nSince the result is positive, Corning has positive working capital based on FY2022 data.\n\nHowever, in this specific case, working capital might not be a useful or relevant metric for this company because a large portion of its assets and liabilities are not considered in the calculation of working capital. The working capital metric only accounts for current assets and liabilities, excluding long-term debt and other non-current items.

However, we can also calculate FCF by adding back depreciation and amortization to net income and then subtracting capex. The two methods should yield the same result.\n\nLet's calculate FCF by subtracting capex from the net cash provided by operating activities:\nFCF = Net cash provided by operating activities - Capex\nFCF = $3,676.2 million - $486.2 million\n\nWe can also calculate FCF by adding back depreciation and amortization to net earnings (not included in the statement of cash flows provided) and then subtracting capex. However, we don't have the net earnings figure directly. But we can calculate it using the given data by reversing the process described in the statement of cash flows, which is not required in this case since we already have the net cash provided by operating activities.

The information provided mentions several factors that impacted the cost of products sold: one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs, currency impacts, commodity inflation, and supply chain benefits.\n\nSince consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income as a percent to sales decreased from 24.3% in 2021 to 22.9% in 2022, it implies a decrease in gross margin. This decrease can be linked to the factors mentioned that increased the cost of products sold. Specifically, the one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs and commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments directly contributed to the increase in cost of products sold, which in turn, led to the decrease in gross margin. \n\nHowever, it's worth noting that a decrease in gross margin may not necessarily be a bad thing, especially if the company is able to make up for it with higher profit margins from other segments. But, in general, a decrease in gross margin can be a cause for concern if it's not offset by other factors.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nThe gross margin change as of FY2022 for JnJ was driven by the following factors: \n- One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs\n- Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment\n- Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the usefulness of gross margin as a metric can be limited for a company like JnJ, which has diverse segments with varying profitability profiles.", "extracted_answer": "final answer\nthe gross margin change as of fy2022 for jnj was driven by the following factors: \n- one-time covid-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs\n- currency impacts in the pharmaceutical segment\n- commodity inflation in the medtech and consumer health segments.\n\nhowever, it's worth noting that the usefulness of gross margin as a metric can be limited for a company like jnj, which has diverse segments with varying profitability profiles.", "is_correct": 0.5, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution using the correct answer as a reference.**\n\n- **Correct Answer Factors:**\n  - One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs\n  - Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment\n  - Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments\n  - Partially offset by Supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment\n\n- **Proposed Solution Factors:**\n  - One-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs\n  - Currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment\n  - Commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments\n\nThe proposed solution includes the first three factors from the correct answer but omits the fourth factor: \"Supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment.\"\n\n- **Conclusion on Usefulness of Gross Margin:**\n  - The proposed solution mentions that the usefulness of gross margin as a metric can be limited for a company like J&J due to its diverse segments with varying profitability profiles.
