Capital-intensive businesses typically have higher asset levels compared to their sales, indicating a significant investment in physical or intangible assets.\n\n## Step 3: Calculating the asset turnover ratio to determine capital intensity\nThe asset turnover ratio helps in understanding the efficiency with which a company uses its assets to generate sales. However, for assessing capital intensity, we will look at the opposite, the total asset turnover ratio is calculated as: Total Sales / Total Assets. However, since the problem asks us to determine if it's capital-intensive and not the efficiency of asset usage we will look at other ratios like asset-to-sales ratio or return on assets (ROA). For this case, we will use the asset-to-sales ratio.\n\nAsset-to-sales ratio = Total assets / Net sales\nAsset-to-sales ratio = $46,455 million / $34,229 million\nAsset-to-sales ratio = 1.355\n\nA higher asset-to-sales ratio indicates that the company has a higher investment in assets relative to its sales, suggesting capital intensity. However, we also need to consider other metrics to get a clearer picture.\n\n## Step 4: Reasoning on other metrics\nConsidering the goodwill impairment expense ($271 million), long-lived and indefinite-lived asset impairment expense ($618 million) and other asset values (like property, plant and equipment of $25,998 million), it suggests that 3M has significant investments in tangible and intangible assets, which are long-term assets.\n\n## Step 5: Conclusion\nBased on the high asset-to-sales ratio and the significant investments in long-lived and intangible assets, it can be concluded that 3M is indeed a capital-intensive business.\n\n## Step 6: Answer\n\\boxed{Yes}", "extracted_answer": "Yes", "is_correct": 0, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n**Correct Answer:**  \n- The correct answer states that 3M is not a capital-intensive business. This conclusion is based on the following metrics:\n  - CAPEX/Revenue Ratio: 5.1%\n  - Fixed assets/Total Assets: 20%\n  - Return on Assets: 12.4%\n\nThese metrics suggest that 3M is managing its capital expenditures and fixed assets efficiently, indicating a lower level of capital intensity.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**  \n- The proposed solution concludes that 3M is a capital-intensive business.\n\n**Comparison:**  \n- The proposed solution directly contradicts the correct answer.

Operating margin is a useful metric for understanding a company's profitability, as it represents the percentage of revenue that a company retains as profit after deducting variable costs and fixed expenses. However, the given context does not provide information on how the operating income or revenue changed in 2022, making it difficult to calculate the operating margin directly.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nSince the given information does not provide a direct calculation or comparison of operating margin for FY 2022, and the increase in SG&A is a significant factor, it can be inferred that the operating margin likely decreased due to the increase in SG&A expenses. However, without more detailed information, we cannot provide an exact percentage or comparison to a previous year. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided context is:\n\nOperating margin likely decreased in 2022 due to the increase in SG&A expenses, but the exact percentage change is not calculable with the given information.\n\nHowever, if you want a more specific format answer with no actual numbers, the most accurate response to the prompt is:\n\n\\boxed{The change in operating margin is unknown but likely decreased due to the increase in SG&A expenses.}", "extracted_answer": "The change in operating margin is unknown but likely decreased due to the increase in SG&A expenses.", "is_correct": 0, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n**Correct Answer:**\n- Operating margin for 3M in FY2022 decreased by 1.7%.\n- Reasons include:\n  - Decrease in gross margin.\n  - One-off charges such as litigation, impairment, costs related to exiting Russia, and divestiture-related restructuring charges.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n- The change in operating margin is unknown but likely decreased due to the increase in SG&A expenses.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- The correct answer specifies a decrease in operating margin by 1.7% and provides specific reasons for this decrease, including a decrease in gross margin and various one-off charges.\n- The proposed solution suggests that the change in operating margin is unknown but likely decreased due to an increase in SG&A expenses.

This indicates that Adobe's investing activities have become more cash-efficient. Therefore, while the FCF conversion ratio has decreased, the actual cash used for investing activities has decreased more significantly, which could be considered an improvement in terms of cash management.\n\nHowever, based on the provided data, we can only conclude that Adobe's FCF conversion ratio has decreased from FY2021 to FY2022.\n\n\\boxed{No}", "extracted_answer": "No", "is_correct": 0, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution**\n\n- **Correct Answer:** The Free Cash Flow (FCF) conversion for Adobe has improved by approximately 13% from 143% in 2021 to 156% in 2022.\n- **Proposed Solution:** No\n\nThe correct answer indicates that Adobe's FCF conversion has indeed improved, as evidenced by the increase from 143% to 156%.

It is calculated by dividing the quick assets (current assets minus inventories and prepaid expenses) by current liabilities. The quick ratio is considered to be a more accurate measure of a company's liquidity than the current ratio when the company has a large proportion of its assets tied up in inventory or prepaid expenses.\n\nIn this case, the current assets include $3,771 million in inventories. Inventories are typically not considered a liquid asset because they are not easily convertible into cash. Prepaid expenses are also not liquid assets because they are payments made in advance for goods or services that have not yet been received. Therefore, the quick ratio would be more relevant to measure AMD's liquidity.\n\nTo calculate the quick ratio for AMD in 2022, we need to subtract the inventories and prepaid expenses from the current assets and divide the result by the current liabilities.\n\n## Step 3: Quick Ratio Calculation\nQuick assets in 2022 = Current assets - Inventories - Prepaid expenses\n= $15,019 million - $3,771 million - $1,265 million\n= $10,983 million\n\nQuick ratio for AMD in 2022 = Quick assets / Current liabilities\n= $10,983 million / $6,369 million\n= 1.73\n\nA quick ratio of 1.73 indicates that AMD has more than enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities, which suggests a reasonably healthy liquidity profile.", "extracted_answer": "quick ratio calculation\nquick assets in 2022 = current assets - inventories - prepaid expenses\n= $15,019 million - $3,771 million - $1,265 million\n= $10,983 million\n\nquick ratio for amd in 2022 = quick assets / current liabilities\n= $10,983 million / $6,369 million\n= 1.73\n\na quick ratio of 1.73 indicates that amd has more than enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities, which suggests a reasonably healthy liquidity profile.", "is_correct": 0.5, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Correct Answer Analysis:**\n   - The correct answer states that AMD has a quick ratio of 1.57.\n   - This indicates a reasonably healthy liquidity profile, as the quick ratio is above 1, meaning AMD has more liquid assets than current liabilities.\n\n2. **Proposed Solution Analysis:**\n   - The proposed solution calculates the quick ratio as 1.73.\n   - The calculation is based on:\n     - Quick assets = $15,019 million (current assets) - $3,771 million (inventories) - $1,265 million (prepaid expenses) = $10,983 million.\n     - Quick ratio = $10,983 million / $6,369 million = 1.73.\n   - The proposed solution concludes that a quick ratio of 1.73 indicates a healthy liquidity profile.\n\n3. **Comparison:**\n   - The proposed solution's quick ratio (1.73) is different from the correct answer's quick ratio (1.57).\n   - However, both the proposed solution and the correct answer conclude that AMD has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile.\n\n### Step 2: Final Judgement\n\n- The proposed solution reaches the same conclusion as the correct answer regarding AMD's liquidity profile, despite the difference in the quick ratio value.\n- Therefore, the final judgement is:\n\n\\boxed{Partial}"}

A business is considered capital-intensive if it invests heavily in assets such as property, equipment, and intangible assets, which are not easily convertible to cash and have a relatively long lifespan.\n\n## Step 3: Reasoning continued\nLooking at the Consolidated Balance Sheets for FY2022, we can see the total assets of CVS Health were $228,275 million.

The total operating costs for FY2022 were $314,721 million.\n\n## Step 4: Reasoning continued\nHowever, we need to look at the key assets that contribute to capital intensity, such as property and equipment, net, operating lease right-of-use assets, goodwill, intangible assets, net, and long-term investments. These assets were $12,873 million + $17,872 million + $78,150 million + $24,754 million + $21,096 million = $154,645 million.\n\n## Step 5: Reasoning continued\nThese key assets represent approximately 68% of the total assets ($154,645 million / $228,275 million), indicating that CVS Health has a significant investment in these capital-intensive assets.\n\n## Step 6: Reasoning continued\nAdditionally, the ratio of total operating costs to total assets for FY2022 was 1.38 ($314,721 million / $228,275 million), which is close to one, suggesting that the company's operating costs are roughly equal to its total assets, indicating a high level of capital intensity.\n\n## Step 7: Reasoning continued\nTherefore, considering the significant investment in key capital-intensive assets and the high ratio of operating costs to total assets, CVS Health appears to be a capital-intensive business.\n\n## Step 8: Reasoning continued\nHowever, we need to also consider the type of business CVS Health operates in, which is a retail pharmacy and health care provider. Such businesses typically require significant investments in physical stores, equipment, and technology to provide services to customers.\n\n## Step 9: Reasoning continued\nGiven the context and the analysis above, it can be concluded that CVS Health's business model is likely to be capital-intensive due to the nature of the industry it operates in and the significant investment in key capital-intensive assets.\n\n## Step 10: Reasoning continued\nTo further solidify this conclusion, we can also look at the net income from operations in relation to the operating costs. A lower net income from operations in relation to operating costs would suggest that the business is not generating sufficient returns from its operations to justify its capital intensity.\n\n## Step 11: Reasoning continued\nHowever, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context. But, with the given information and understanding of the industry, we can conclude that CVS Health is a capital-intensive business.\n\n## Step 12: Reasoning continued\nBased on the analysis above, we can provide a definitive conclusion.\n\n## Step 13: Final Answer\n\\boxed{Yes}", "extracted_answer": "Yes", "is_correct": 1, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution using the correct answer as a reference.**\n\n- The correct answer states that CVS Health is a capital-intensive business, supported by its low ROA of 1.82% in 2022 and 3.39% in 2021.

In this case, the document doesn't provide the exact gross margin values but mentions the percentages of consolidated earnings before provision for taxes on income as 22.9% and 24.3% for 2022 and 2021, respectively. However, to determine the drivers of the change in gross margin, we need to consider the factors that affected the cost of products sold.\n\n- The factors driving the increase in the cost of products sold include one-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs, currency impacts in the Pharmaceutical segment, and commodity inflation in the MedTech and Consumer Health segments. These factors would decrease the gross margin as they increase the cost of products sold.\n- On the other hand, supply chain benefits in the Consumer Health segment partially offset these increases. This would help to increase the gross margin slightly.\n- Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense included in cost of products sold decreased from $4.7 billion in 2021 to $4.3 billion in 2022, which would also contribute to a slight increase in gross margin.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nGiven the factors that affect cost of products sold, it is difficult to determine the exact impact on the gross margin.

EBITDA margin = (Unadjusted EBITDA / Net Sales) * 100\n\n- FY2018 EBITDA Margin = ($30,966 million / $495,761 million) * 100 \u2248 6.23%\n- FY2019 EBITDA Margin = ($32,635 million / $510,329 million) * 100 \u2248 6.39%\n- FY2020 EBITDA Margin = ($31,555 million / $519,926 million) * 100 \u2248 6.06%\n\nTo calculate the 3-year average EBITDA margin, we add up the margins for each year and divide by 3:\n\n3-Year Average EBITDA Margin = (6.23% + 6.39% + 6.06%) / 3 \u2248 6.23%\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\n\\boxed{6.2%}", "extracted_answer": "6.2%", "is_correct": 1, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Correct Answer**: The correct answer is 6.2% for the FY2018 - FY2020 3-year average unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Walmart.\n\n2. **Proposed Solution**: The proposed solution also states 6.2%.\n\n3. **Comparison**: The proposed solution's final conclusion (6.2%) aligns perfectly with the correct answer (6.2%).\n\nSince the proposed solution reaches the same conclusion as the correct answer, we can determine that the proposed solution is correct.\n\n### Step 2: Output Final Judgement\n\nThe proposed solution aligns with the correct answer, so the final judgement is:\n\n\\boxed{Correct}"}
