SG&A includes various expenses such as salaries, marketing, and other administrative costs. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the additional expenses listed above, which were not present in the same magnitude in the previous year. These expenses include a significant one-time charge for litigation and various restructuring costs. The only other factor mentioned that had a positive impact was cost management, but it was not enough to offset the increases.\n\nOperating margin is a key metric that shows the profitability of a company by comparing net income to revenue. It essentially measures the profit earned on each dollar of sales. Given the context, operating margin would be affected by the changes in SG&A, as a significant increase in SG&A expenses would reduce profitability. However, the increase in SG&A was not directly mentioned to be offset by equivalent revenue increases, which would be necessary to maintain or improve operating margin.\n\nTherefore, the increase in SG&A is likely to have negatively impacted operating margin, making it a useful metric for understanding the impact of these expenses on the company's profitability.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\n\\boxed{The increase in SG&A, primarily driven by one-time charges and restructuring costs, likely negatively impacted the operating margin as of FY2022.}", "extracted_answer": "The increase in SG&A, primarily driven by one-time charges and restructuring costs, likely negatively impacted the operating margin as of FY2022.", "is_correct": 0.5, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n**Correct Answer:**\n- Operating margin decreased by 1.7%.\n- Reasons include:\n  - Decrease in gross margin.\n  - One-off charges such as Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia, and divestiture-related restructuring charges.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n- Increase in SG&A, primarily driven by one-time charges and restructuring costs, likely negatively impacted the operating margin.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Both the correct answer and the proposed solution identify one-time charges and restructuring costs as factors impacting the operating margin.\n- The correct answer specifies these as reasons for the decrease in operating margin, while the proposed solution attributes the impact to an increase in SG&A.\n- The proposed solution does not mention the decrease in gross margin, which is a key point in the correct answer.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The proposed solution aligns with the correct answer in identifying one-time charges and restructuring costs as factors affecting the operating margin.\n- However, it does not mention the decrease in gross margin, which is a significant part of the correct answer.\n\n### Step 2: Final Judgement\n\nThe proposed solution reaches a similar conclusion regarding the impact of one-time charges and restructuring costs on the operating margin, but it omits the decrease in gross margin.

The decrease in operating income from $3.6 billion in 2021 to $1.3 billion in 2022 is primarily attributed to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the Xilinx acquisition. Operating margin can be calculated by dividing the operating income by revenue. However, the provided context does not explicitly state the revenue for 2021 and 2022.

The increase in non-interest revenues from 2021 to 2022 is 24.8% (from $34,630 to $42,967). The difference in growth rates between these two indicates that the main driver of the increase in non-interest revenue margin is the significant growth in non-interest revenues rather than the growth in total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses.\n\nBreaking down the non-interest revenues, the most significant contributors to the growth are:\n- Net card fees increased by 16.5% ($5,195 to $6,070).\n- Service fees and other revenue increased by 36.2% ($3,316 to $4,521).\n\nHowever, the exact contribution of each component to the overall increase in non-interest revenue margin cannot be precisely determined without more detailed information on the cost structures associated with these revenue streams.\n\nGiven the provided information, the increase in non-interest revenue margin as of FY2022 for American Express can be attributed primarily to the growth in non-interest revenues, driven by significant increases in Net card fees and Service fees and other revenue, with Net card fees increasing by 16.5% and Service fees and other revenue increasing by 36.2%.\n\nSince the gross margin is not directly applicable to a company like American Express that operates primarily on non-interest revenue streams, the non-interest revenue margin provides a useful metric for understanding the change in profitability.", "extracted_answer": "calculating non-interest revenue margin for 2021 and 2022\n\nnon-interest revenue margin for 2022 = (42,967 + 9,895) / 50,680 = 52,862 / 50,680 \u2248 1.044 or 104.4%\nnon-interest revenue margin for 2021 = (34,630 + 7,750) / 43,799 = 42,380 / 43,799 \u2248 0.967 or 96.7%\n\ncomparing the non-interest revenue margins for 2021 and 2022, there's an increase of about 7.7% (from 96.7% to 104.4%). this suggests an improvement in non-interest revenue margin from 2021 to 2022.\n\n## step 4: analyzing drivers of change\nto determine the drivers of this change, we need to examine the components of non-interest revenues and total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses.\n\nfrom the provided context, the increase in total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses from 2021 to 2022 is 15.6% (from $43,799 to $50,680). the increase in non-interest revenues from 2021 to 2022 is 24.8% (from $34,630 to $42,967). the difference in growth rates between these two indicates that the main driver of the increase in non-interest revenue margin is the significant growth in non-interest revenues rather than the growth in total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses.\n\nbreaking down the non-interest revenues, the most significant contributors to the growth are:\n- net card fees increased by 16.5% ($5,195 to $6,070).\n- service fees and other revenue increased by 36.2% ($3,316 to $4,521).\n\nhowever, the exact contribution of each component to the overall increase in non-interest revenue margin cannot be precisely determined without more detailed information on the cost structures associated with these revenue streams.\n\ngiven the provided information, the increase in non-interest revenue margin as of fy2022 for american express can be attributed primarily to the growth in non-interest revenues, driven by significant increases in net card fees and service fees and other revenue, with net card fees increasing by 16.5% and service fees and other revenue increasing by 36.2%.\n\nsince the gross margin is not directly applicable to a company like american express that operates primarily on non-interest revenue streams, the non-interest revenue margin provides a useful metric for understanding the change in profitability.", "is_correct": 1, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n**Correct Answer:** The correct answer states that performance is not measured through gross margin for a company like American Express.
