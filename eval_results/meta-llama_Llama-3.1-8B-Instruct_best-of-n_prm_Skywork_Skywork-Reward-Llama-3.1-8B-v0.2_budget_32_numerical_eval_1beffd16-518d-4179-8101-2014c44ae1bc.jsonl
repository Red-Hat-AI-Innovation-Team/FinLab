If SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increase, it typically means that the operating income is decreasing relative to sales, leading to a decrease in operating margin. \n\nGiven the negative factors affecting SG&A and their impact on operating income, it can be inferred that these factors drove a change in operating margin, likely a decrease, for 3M as of FY2022.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\n\\boxed{The increase in SG&A expenses, driven by various negative factors, likely resulted in a decrease in operating margin as of FY2022 for 3M.}", "extracted_answer": "The increase in SG&A expenses, driven by various negative factors, likely resulted in a decrease in operating margin as of FY2022 for 3M.", "is_correct": 0.5, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n**Correct Answer:**\n- Operating margin for 3M in FY2022 decreased by 1.7%.\n- Reasons include:\n  - Decrease in gross margin.\n  - One-off charges such as litigation, impairment, costs related to exiting Russia, and divestiture-related restructuring charges.\n\n**Proposed Solution:**\n- Suggests that the increase in SG&A expenses, driven by various negative factors, likely resulted in a decrease in operating margin.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- The correct answer attributes the decrease in operating margin to a decrease in gross margin and specific one-off charges.\n- The proposed solution focuses on an increase in SG&A expenses as the primary driver.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The proposed solution does not align with the correct answer because it emphasizes SG&A expenses rather than the decrease in gross margin and one-off charges.\n- The final conclusion in the proposed solution (decrease in operating margin) is correct, but the reasoning is different.\n\n### Step 2: Final Judgement\n\nThe proposed solution reaches the same conclusion about the decrease in operating margin but provides a different reasoning.

The mention of lawsuits from state Attorneys General, governmental subdivisions, and several putative class actions against the company indicates that CVS Health is facing significant legal challenges. The settlement agreement in December 2022 does not signify the end of all legal battles but rather a resolution of opioid claims with a subset of plaintiffs. Therefore, it can be inferred that CVS Health has ongoing legal battles from 2022, given the settlement's recent nature.
