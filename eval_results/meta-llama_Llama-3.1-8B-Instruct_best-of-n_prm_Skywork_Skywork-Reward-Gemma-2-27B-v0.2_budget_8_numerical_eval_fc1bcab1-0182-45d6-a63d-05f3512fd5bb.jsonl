An increase in SG&A expenses, as described in the context, would typically lead to a decrease in operating margin, as a larger portion of revenue is being allocated towards expenses rather than profit.\n\nIn this case, the factors driving the increase in SG&A expenses include significant litigation costs, impairment costs, and restructuring charges, which would all contribute to a decrease in operating margin. However, these increases were partially offset by restructuring benefits and cost management, which might mitigate some of the negative impact on operating margin.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nGiven the increase in SG&A expenses, driven by significant litigation costs, impairment costs, and restructuring charges, the operating margin is likely to have decreased as of FY2022 for 3M.", "extracted_answer": "final answer\ngiven the increase in sg&a expenses, driven by significant litigation costs, impairment costs, and restructuring charges, the operating margin is likely to have decreased as of fy2022 for 3m.", "is_correct": 1, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution using the correct answer as a reference.**\n\n- **Correct Answer Summary:**\n  - Operating margin decreased by 1.7%.\n  - Reasons include a decrease in gross margin and one-off charges such as litigation, impairment, and restructuring costs.\n\n- **Proposed Solution Summary:**\n  - Operating margin likely decreased due to increased SG&A expenses.\n  - These expenses were driven by litigation costs, impairment costs, and restructuring charges.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- Both the correct answer and the proposed solution identify a decrease in operating margin.\n- The correct answer attributes the decrease to a decrease in gross margin and specific one-off charges.\n- The proposed solution focuses on increased SG&A expenses due to litigation, impairment, and restructuring charges.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The proposed solution aligns with the correct answer in terms of the overall conclusion: the operating margin decreased.\n- The proposed solution does not explicitly mention the decrease in gross margin but focuses on the increase in SG&A expenses, which is consistent with the one-off charges mentioned in the correct answer.\n\n**Final Judgement:**\nThe proposed solution reaches the same conclusion as the correct answer, despite focusing on different aspects of the financial changes.\n\n\\boxed{Correct}"}

However, since we only have the ending inventory and cost of sales data, we will calculate it as follows:\n\nCOGS = Revenue - Gross Profit\nGross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Sales\n\nGross Profit for FY2022 = $12,617 million (revenue) - $10,069 million (cost of sales) = $2,548 million\n\nCOGS for FY2022 = $12,617 million (revenue) - $2,548 million (Gross Profit) = $10,069 million\n\nInventory turnover ratio is calculated by dividing the COGS by the average inventory. Since we do not have the beginning inventory, we will use the ending inventory as a proxy.\n\nAverage inventory = (Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory) / 2\nHowever, since we only have the ending inventory, we will use the ending inventory to approximate the average inventory for simplicity.\n\nInventory turnover ratio = COGS / Average Inventory\nSince we can't calculate average inventory, we'll use COGS/Ending Inventory instead.\nInventory turnover = $10,069 million / $1,055 million \u2248 9.54 times\n\nHowever, conventional inventory management and turn-over ratio analysis may not be meaningful for a company with a large portion of regulated sales or those with variable cost structures.

Since capital expenditures is a component of the net cash used in investing activities, we can assume that capital expenditures is close to the net cash used in investing activities for FY2018, given that there are other items included in the net cash used in investing activities such as disposition of property and equipment, proceeds from Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas transaction, etc.\n3.  To calculate the capex as a percentage of revenue for FY2018, we will divide the capex by the total revenue and then multiply by 100.\n4.  We will repeat the process for FY2019 and FY2020 to get their capex as a percentage of revenue.\n5.  Then, we will find the average of the three percentages to get the 3-year average.\n\n## Step 3: Calculations\n\n- FY2018 capex as a % of revenue = (-$1,486,843 / $11,763,096) x 100\n- FY2019 capital expenditures is not directly given, but we have the net cash used in investing activities for FY2019, which is $3,519,434. We also have capital expenditures, net of construction payable for FY2019, which is -$739,006. \n- We will assume capital expenditures for FY2019 is close to the net cash used in investing activities for FY2019, given that there are other items included in the net cash used in investing activities for FY2019 such as dispositions of property and equipment, etc.\n- FY2019 capex as a % of revenue = ($3,519,434 / $12,899,672) x 100\n- FY2020 capital expenditures is not directly given, but we have the net cash used in investing activities for FY2020, which is $2,159,304. We also have capital expenditures, net of construction payable for FY2020, which is -$270,579. \n- We will assume capital expenditures for FY2020 is close to the net cash used in investing activities for FY2020, given that there are other items included in the net cash used in investing activities for FY2020 such as dispositions of property and equipment, etc.\n- FY2020 capex as a % of revenue = ($2,159,304 / $12,899,672) x 100\n- Then, we will find the average of the three percentages to get the 3-year average.\n\n## Step 4: Execution of the calculations\n\n- FY2018 capex as a % of revenue = (-$1,486,843 / $11,763,096) x 100 = -12.62%\n- FY2019 capex as a % of revenue = ($3,519,434 / $12,899,672) x 100 = 27.32%\n- FY2020 capex as a % of revenue = ($2,159,304 / $12,899,672) x 100 = 16.72%\n- 3-year average capex as a % of revenue = (-12.62 + 27.32 + 16.72) / 3 = 10.47%\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{10.5}$", "extracted_answer": "10.5", "is_correct": 0, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Correct Answer**: The 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue for MGM Resorts from FY2018 to FY2020 is 7.9%.\n\n2. **Proposed Solution**: The proposed solution concludes with a 10.5% average.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - The proposed solution's conclusion (10.5%) does not match the correct answer (7.9%).\n   - The proposed solution does not align with the correct answer.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the proposed solution's final conclusion (10.5%) is different from the correct answer (7.9%), it does not reach the same conclusion.\n\n### Step 2: Output Final Judgement\n\nBased on the analysis, the proposed solution does not reach the same conclusion as the correct answer.

However, the provided information does not explicitly mention wages as a separate line item. We can, however, infer that wages are a part of the store payroll and benefits mentioned in the context.\n\nThe context states that SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to 23.5% in fiscal 2022 from 23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments. This implies that even though wages and benefits as a percentage of net sales might have increased due to wage investments, the overall SG&A as a percentage of net sales still decreased.\n\nHowever, the exact change in wages expense as a percentage of net sales cannot be determined from the provided information.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\n\\boxed{There is not enough information to determine if wages expense as a percent of net sales increased or decreased.}", "extracted_answer": "There is not enough information to determine if wages expense as a percent of net sales increased or decreased.", "is_correct": 0, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution using the correct answer as a reference.**\n\n- **Correct Answer:** Wages expense as a percent of net sales increased in FY2023.\n- **Proposed Solution:** There is not enough information to determine if wages expense as a percent of net sales increased or decreased.\n\nThe proposed solution concludes that there is insufficient information to determine the change in wages expense as a percent of net sales.

The quick ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of current assets (excluding inventories) by the total current liabilities.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate current assets excluding inventories for FY 2022\nCurrent assets excluding inventories = Current assets - Inventories\n= $37,857 million - $2,388 million\n= $35,469 million\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the quick ratio for FY 2022\nQuick ratio = (Current assets excluding inventories) / Total current liabilities\n= $35,469 million / $50,171 million\n= 0.707\n\n## Step 5: Reasoning to evaluate liquidity profile\nA quick ratio of 0.707 indicates that Verizon can cover 70.7% of its current liabilities with its liquid assets.
