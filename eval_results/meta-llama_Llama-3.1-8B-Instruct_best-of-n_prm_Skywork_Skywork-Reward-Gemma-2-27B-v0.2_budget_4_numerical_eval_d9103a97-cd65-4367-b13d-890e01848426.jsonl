However, SG&A expenses do contribute to operating expenses, which, in turn, affect operating income and subsequently operating margin.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nWithout specific information on operating income or other components that directly impact operating margin, it's challenging to accurately determine the change in operating margin solely based on the provided context. However, we can infer that SG&A expenses increased due to various special item costs and investments, which could negatively impact operating profit and margin if not offset by other factors.\n\nSince the document doesn't provide a clear, direct link to operating margin, and we cannot accurately calculate it from the given information, we can conclude that operating margin might not be a useful metric to analyze using the provided context.

(the Substitute Issuer), each a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amcor plc (the Company), entered into two agreements: a Second Supplemental Indenture and a First Supplemental Indenture with the Trustee.\n- The purpose of these agreements was the substitution of the Substitute Issuer for the Former Issuer and the assumption by the Substitute Issuer of the covenants of the Former Issuer under the Indentures.\n- The New Notes were issued in June 2019 following the completion of the Former Issuers exchange offer to certain eligible holders of the Existing Notes.\n- There is a mention of a Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on June 17, 2019.\n- Amcor filed another 8-K report, but the date is not specified.\n\n## Step 2: Reasoning\nBased on the information provided, it seems that the key agenda of the 8-K filing dated June 30, 2022 is related to the agreements between Amcor Finance (USA), Inc. and Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc. regarding the substitution of the Substitute Issuer for the Former Issuer and the assumption of the covenants of the Former Issuer under the Indentures. However, the exact details of the 8-K report on June 30, 2022, are not specified in the given document.

This ratio is also known as the acid-test ratio and it measures a company's short-term liquidity and its ability to meet its short-term obligations.\n- Quick ratio for FY2023 = ($5,308 - $2,213) / $4,476\n- Quick ratio for FY2023 = $3,095 / $4,476 \u2248 0.692\n- Quick ratio for FY2022 = ($5,853 - $2,439) / $5,103\n- Quick ratio for FY2022 = $3,414 / $5,103 \u2248 0.667\n- To determine if the quick ratio has improved, we compare the two values. The quick ratio for FY2023 is 0.692 and for FY2022 is 0.667.

This implies that the acquisition of Xilinx likely involved significant intangible assets that were amortized over time, contributing to the decrease in operating income.

Since the TBVPS is the total book value of the firm divided by the number of outstanding shares, if the firm liquidates all its assets, each shareholder would theoretically be entitled to the TBVPS per share.
