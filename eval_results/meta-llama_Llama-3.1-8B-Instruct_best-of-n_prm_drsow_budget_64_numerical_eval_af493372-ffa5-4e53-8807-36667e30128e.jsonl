However, since the provided financial statement uses \"total revenues net of interest expense\" as the metric, we should focus on this figure instead of the traditional gross profit.\n\nThe change in gross margin is best reflected by examining the change in the \"Total revenues net of interest expense\" figure. To find out what drove this change, we need to compare the growth in non-interest revenues and interest income relative to total revenues net of interest expense.\n\nNon-interest revenues have grown from $28,102 million in 2020 to $42,967 million in 2022, showing a 52.5% increase.

However, in the case of American Express, a significant portion of its revenue comes from non-interest activities such as card fees, service fees, and other revenue streams.\n\nWhile the interest income and interest expense have influenced the change in total revenues net of interest expense, the primary driver of the growth in total revenues net of interest expense for American Express in 2022 appears to be the significant increase in non-interest revenues, rather than the change in interest income and interest expense.\n\nTherefore, the key driver of the change in \"total revenues net of interest expense\" is the growth in non-interest revenues, particularly card fees, service fees, and other revenue streams, which contributed to the 46.5% increase from 2020 to 2022.\n\nNon-interest revenues have seen a much higher growth rate than interest income and interest expense, thus, this is what primarily drove the increase in total revenues net of interest expense.", "extracted_answer": "final answer\ngross margin is indeed a useful metric for companies with significant interest income and expense, as it reflects the profitability of their interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. however, in the case of american express, a significant portion of its revenue comes from non-interest activities such as card fees, service fees, and other revenue streams.\n\nwhile the interest income and interest expense have influenced the change in total revenues net of interest expense, the primary driver of the growth in total revenues net of interest expense for american express in 2022 appears to be the significant increase in non-interest revenues, rather than the change in interest income and interest expense.\n\ntherefore, the key driver of the change in \"total revenues net of interest expense\" is the growth in non-interest revenues, particularly card fees, service fees, and other revenue streams, which contributed to the 46.5% increase from 2020 to 2022.\n\nnon-interest revenues have seen a much higher growth rate than interest income and interest expense, thus, this is what primarily drove the increase in total revenues net of interest expense.", "is_correct": 1, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution using the correct answer as a reference.**\n\n- **Correct Answer:** Performance is not measured through gross margin for American Express.\n- **Proposed Solution:** The solution discusses the role of gross margin and concludes that the key driver of the change in \"total revenues net of interest expense\" is the growth in non-interest revenues, not gross margin.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n- The proposed solution acknowledges that gross margin is not the primary metric for American Express, as a significant portion of its revenue comes from non-interest activities.\n- It correctly identifies that non-interest revenues, such as card fees and service fees, are the primary drivers of revenue growth, aligning with the idea that gross margin is not the main performance measure.\n- The conclusion of the proposed solution does not contradict the correct answer; it supports the notion that gross margin is not the key metric by focusing on non-interest revenues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe final conclusion in the proposed solution aligns with the correct answer, as it emphasizes the importance of non-interest revenues over gross margin for American Express.\n\n**Step 2: Output your final judgment.**\n\n\\boxed{Correct}"}
