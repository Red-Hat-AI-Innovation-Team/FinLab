Operating margin is a useful metric for evaluating a company's profitability, and it is calculated as operating income divided by revenue.

The operating margin is calculated as (Total revenues net of interest expense - Total expenses) / Total revenues net of interest expense.\n\nFor 2022: (52,862 - 41,095) / 52,862 = 22.2%\nFor 2021: (42,380 - 33,110) / 42,380 = 21.8%\nFor 2020: (36,087 - 27,061) / 36,087 = 25.1%\n\nFrom the above calculation, the operating margin for 2022 (22.2%) is lower than 2020 (25.1%), and 2021 (21.8%) is also lower than 2020 (25.1%). This indicates that the operating margin of AMEX is not improving.\n\nHowever, operating margin might not be a suitable metric for companies like American Express, which are heavily involved in financial transactions and have a significant amount of provisions for credit losses.

However, we can infer that there was a decrease in the earnings before provision for taxes on income and a change in the cost of products sold as a percent to sales.
