However, since the question specifically asks about what drove the change in operating margin as of FY2022 and the information provided focuses on the increase in SG&A expenses, we will focus on this aspect. \nThe increase in SG&A expenses due to various factors such as litigation costs, impairment costs, and divestiture-related charges would typically lead to a decrease in operating margin because these expenses reduce the net income of the company, which in turn reduces the operating margin.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nOperating margin is a useful metric for understanding a company's profitability and efficiency.

Gross profit is the total revenue minus the cost of sales. Then, we'll use the formula for inventory turnover ratio which is: Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory. We also need to find the average inventory for the year. If the inventory turnover ratio is higher, it indicates that the company is selling its inventory more frequently.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the Gross Profit and Average Inventory for FY2022\n- Gross Profit = Total Revenue - Cost of Sales = $12,617 million - $10,069 million = $2,548 million\n- Since we don't have the beginning and ending inventory, we'll assume the inventory balance at the beginning and end of the year are roughly equal. Therefore, the average inventory will be the average of the beginning and ending inventory for the year which we don't have, instead, we will be using the given ending inventory for the calculation.\n- Inventory Turnover Ratio = Cost of Goods Sold / Average Inventory = $10,069 million / ($1,055 million) = 9.53\n\n## Step 4: Consider the result\nSince the inventory turnover ratio is 9.53, it is high, which typically indicates that the company is selling its inventory more frequently, and conventional inventory management is meaningful for the AES Corporation.\n\n## Step 5: Consider if conventional inventory management is meaningful for the company\nInventory turnover ratio of 9.53 is high, which indicates that the company sells its inventory quite frequently. This ratio suggests that the company maintains a small inventory and sells its products regularly.

First, we need to calculate the constant currency growth. For that, we need to adjust the net sales for the impact of FX. \nNet sales in constant currency for 2023 can be calculated as follows:\n   Net sales in constant currency for 2023 = Net sales for 2023 - (FX impact on net sales for 2023)\n   Net sales in constant currency for 2023 = $14,694 - ($14,694 * 1% FX impact)\n   Net sales in constant currency for 2023 = $14,694 - $146.94\n   Net sales in constant currency for 2023 = $14,547.06\n\nSimilarly, Net sales in constant currency for 2022 can be calculated as follows:\n   Net sales in constant currency for 2022 = Net sales for 2022 - (FX impact on net sales for 2022)\n   Net sales in constant currency for 2022 = $14,544 - ($14,544 * -1% FX impact)\n   Net sales in constant currency for 2022 = $14,544 + $145.44\n   Net sales in constant currency for 2022 = $14,689.44\n\nNow, we need to adjust the constant currency sales for the impact of raw material pass through.\nRaw material pass through impact for 2023 = $14,547.06 * 5% = $727.35\nRaw material pass through impact for 2022 = $14,689.44 * 5% = $733.97\n\nNow, we need to adjust the constant currency sales for the impact of items affecting comparability.\nItems affecting comparability for 2023 = $14,547.06 * -1% = $145.47\nItems affecting comparability for 2022 = $14,689.44 * -2% = $293.79\n\nNow, we can calculate the adjusted sales for 2023 and 2022.\nAdjusted sales for 2023 = $14,547.06 - $727.35 - $145.47\nAdjusted sales for 2023 = $13,674.24\nAdjusted sales for 2022 = $14,689.44 - $733.97 - $293.79\nAdjusted sales for 2022 = $13,661.68\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nThe real change in sales for AMCOR in FY 2023 vs FY 2022, if we exclude the impact of FX movement, passthrough costs and one-off items, is:\nAdjusted sales for 2023 - Adjusted sales for 2022 = $13,674.24 - $13,661.68\n= $12.56", "extracted_answer": "final answer\nthe real change in sales for amcor in fy 2023 vs fy 2022, if we exclude the impact of fx movement, passthrough costs and one-off items, is:\nadjusted sales for 2023 - adjusted sales for 2022 = $13,674.24 - $13,661.68\n= $12.56", "is_correct": 1, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution**\n\n- The correct answer states that the Real Growth was flat in FY 2023 vs FY 2022.\n- The proposed solution calculates the real change in sales as $12.56, which is derived from subtracting the adjusted sales for 2022 from the adjusted sales for 2023: $13,674.24 - $13,661.68 = $12.56.\n\nNow, let's interpret what \"flat\" means in this context.

Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the income statement and the balance sheet.", "correct_answer": "-3.7", "model_response": "## Step 1: Calculate the average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019.\nThe average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019 can be calculated by taking the average of the inventories in FY2018 and FY2019. From the balance sheet, we find that the inventory in FY2019 is $1,559.3 million and the inventory in FY2018 is $1,642.2 million. The average inventory is (1,559.3 + 1,642.2) / 2 = $1,600.75 million.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate DIO (Days Inventory Outstanding)\nDIO is defined as 365 * (average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS). The FY2019 COGS is $11,108.4 million. We can now calculate DIO as 365 * (1,600.75) / 11,108.4 = 64.41 days.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019.\nThe average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019 can be calculated by taking the average of the receivables in FY2018 and FY2019. From the balance sheet, we find that the receivables in FY2019 are $1,679.7 million and the receivables in FY2018 are $1,684.2 million. The average receivable is (1,679.7 + 1,684.2) / 2 = $1,681.95 million.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate DSO (Days Sales Outstanding)\nDSO is defined as 365 * (average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 Revenue). The FY2019 Revenue is $16,865.2 million. We can now calculate DSO as 365 * (1,681.95) / 16,865.2 = 41.16 days.\n\n## Step 5: Calculate the average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019.\nThe average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019 can be calculated by taking the average of the accounts payable in FY2018 and FY2019. From the balance sheet, we find that the accounts payable in FY2019 are $2,854.1 million and the accounts payable in FY2018 are $2,746.2 million. The average payable is (2,854.1 + 2,746.2) / 2 = $2,800.15 million.\n\n## Step 6: Calculate the change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019.\nThe change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019 is $1,559.3 - $1,642.2 = -$82.9 million.\n\n## Step 7: Calculate DPO (Days Payable Outstanding)\nDPO is defined as 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS + change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019). The FY2019 COGS is $11,108.4 million and the change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019 is -$82.9 million. We can now calculate DPO as 365 * (2,800.15) / (11,108.4 - 82.9) = 76.42 days.\n\n## Step 8: Calculate the cash conversion cycle (CCC)\nCCC is defined as DIO + DSO - DPO. From the previous steps, we have DIO = 64.41 days, DSO = 41.16 days, and DPO = 76.42 days. We can now calculate CCC as 64.41 + 41.16 - 76.42 = 29.15 days.\n\n## Step 9: Round the CCC to two decimal places.\nThe CCC rounded to two decimal places is 29.15.\n\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{29.15}", "extracted_answer": "29.15", "is_correct": 0, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Correct Answer:** -3.7\n2. **Proposed Solution:** 29.15\n\n- The correct answer is -3.7, which indicates a negative cash conversion cycle.\n- The proposed solution is 29.15, which is significantly different from the correct answer.\n\n- **Decimal Precision Requirement:** The correct answer is given to one decimal place, so we should consider decimal precision in our evaluation.\n\n- **Comparison:**\n  - The proposed solution (29.15) is not only different in integer value but also in decimal value compared to the correct answer (-3.7).\n\n### Step 2: Final Judgement\n\nSince the proposed solution is neither the same as the correct answer nor just a decimal difference, it is incorrect.\n\n\\boxed{Incorrect}"}

A higher proportion of PP&E to total assets indicates that a company is more capital-intensive. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the percentage of PP&E to total assets for both years:\n- FY 2022: (Property, plant and equipment) / (Total assets) = $307,689 million / $379,680 million = 0.8106 or 81.06%\n- FY 2021: (Property, plant and equipment) / (Total assets) = $289,897 million / $366,596 million = 0.7901 or 79.01%\n\nComparing the two percentages, we can see that the proportion of PP&E to total assets in FY 2022 (81.06%) is higher than in FY 2021 (79.01%).
