Calculate the operating income for each year:\n   - 2022: Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses = $50,680 \n   - 2021: Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses = $43,799\n   - 2020: Total revenues net of interest expense after provisions for credit losses = $31,357\n\n2.

This indicates that AMEX's operating margin profile is not improving as of 2022 compared to the previous year.\n\nHowever, this question of whether operating margin is a useful metric for this company is valid. For a company like American Express, which generates significant revenue from interest income and provisions for credit losses, operating margin may not accurately reflect its profitability. The company's performance is heavily influenced by factors such as interest rates, loan defaults, and credit loss provisions, which are not directly reflected in the operating margin.\n\nTherefore, while we can conclude that AMEX's operating margin profile is not improving as of 2022, we should be cautious when interpreting this metric for a company with a complex financial structure like American Express.\n\n\\boxed{No, AMEX's operating margin profile is not improving as of 2022.

The change in provisions for credit losses from 2021 to 2022 is $2,182 million - (-$1,419 million) = $3,601 million.
