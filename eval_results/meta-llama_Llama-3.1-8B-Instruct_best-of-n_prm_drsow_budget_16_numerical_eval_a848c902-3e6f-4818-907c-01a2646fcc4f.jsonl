However, for a financial institution like American Express, which generates revenue from a variety of sources (interest income and non-interest revenues), gross margin might not be as useful as other metrics like net interest income, efficiency ratio, or return on assets. \n\nLooking at the given data, we can see that Total revenues net of interest expense increased by $10,482 million from 2021 to 2022 ($52,862 million - $42,380 million). This increase could be due to a rise in either interest income or non-interest revenue. Interest income, however, decreased by $1,867 million ($12,658 million - $9,033 million). This suggests that the growth in Total revenues net of interest expense is largely driven by an increase in non-interest revenue.\n\nBreaking down the non-interest revenue components:\n- Non-interest revenues increased by $8,337 million ($42,967 million - $34,630 million).\n- Processed revenue, a component of non-interest revenue, increased by $81 million ($1,637 million - $1,556 million).\n\nWhile we do not have explicit numbers for gross margin in the given document, based on the analysis, the increase in Total revenues net of interest expense is largely driven by non-interest revenue, rather than interest income, which indicates a shift in the company's revenue streams.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nGiven the data provided, the change in gross margin cannot be directly calculated and might not be a useful metric for analyzing this company.

The quick ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of current assets minus inventory and prepaid expenses by the total current liabilities. This metric helps to assess a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets.\n\nThe quick ratio = (Current assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses) / Total current liabilities\n\nPlugging in the values from the given context:\n- Current assets = $37,857 million\n- Inventory = $2,388 million\n- Prepaid expenses = $8,358 million\n- Total current liabilities = $50,171 million\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator: \nCurrent assets - Inventory - Prepaid expenses = $37,857 - $2,388 - $8,358 = $27,111 million\n\nThen, calculate the quick ratio:\nQuick ratio = $27,111 million / $50,171 million \u2248 0.541\n\nA quick ratio above 1 is generally considered a good indicator of a company's liquidity, but it can vary based on the industry and other factors.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer \n\\boxed{0.541}", "extracted_answer": "0.541", "is_correct": 1, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution**\n\n- The correct answer states that Verizon's quick ratio for FY 2022 was approximately 0.54, indicating a lack of a healthy liquidity profile.\n- The proposed solution provides a quick ratio of 0.541, which is essentially the same as 0.54 when rounded to two decimal places.\n- Both the correct answer and the proposed solution conclude that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile based on the quick ratio.\n\nSince the proposed solution aligns with the correct answer in terms of the quick ratio value and the conclusion about Verizon's liquidity profile, the final conclusion in the proposed solution is consistent with the correct answer.\n\n**Step 2: Output the Final Judgement**\n\nThe proposed solution reaches the same conclusion as the correct answer.
