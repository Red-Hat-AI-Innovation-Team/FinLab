It might be a sign that the company is in a transitional phase, investing in inventory to support future growth or undergoing some restructuring.

The primary reason for this decrease is the amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. The operating margin is a useful metric for a company like AMD as it helps in understanding the company's profitability from its core operations. However, the amortization of intangible assets is a non-cash item, which can temporarily depress operating income and thus operating margin.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\n\\boxed{The amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition drove the operating margin change as of FY22 for AMD.

In general, a negative working capital might not be a significant concern for companies in the utility sector, like American Water Works, as they might operate with a large amount of long-term contracts and regulatory oversight, which can reduce the need for immediate cash flow. Additionally, utility companies often have predictable cash inflows and outflows due to the nature of their services, which can minimize the impact of short-term liquidity issues.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\n\\boxed{No, American Water Works does not have positive working capital based on FY2022 data.

Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the P&L statement and the cash flow statement.", "correct_answer": "6.2%", "model_response": "## Step 1: Evidence from the context\n\n- Unadjusted EBITDA for FY2018: Operating income (from P&L) + Depreciation and amortization (from cash flow statement) = $20,437 (Operating income from P&L) + $10,529 (Depreciation and amortization from cash flow statement) = $30,966\n- Unadjusted EBITDA for FY2019: Operating income (from P&L) + Depreciation and amortization (from cash flow statement) = $21,957 (Operating income from P&L) + $10,678 (Depreciation and amortization from cash flow statement) = $32,635\n- Unadjusted EBITDA for FY2020: Operating income (from P&L) + Depreciation and amortization (from cash flow statement) = $20,568 (Operating income from P&L) + $10,987 (Depreciation and amortization from cash flow statement) = $31,555\n\n## Step 2: Reasoning\n\n- First, we calculate the net sales for each year:\n  - FY2018: $495,761\n  - FY2019: $510,329\n  - FY2020: $519,926\n- Then, we calculate the EBITDA margin for each year by dividing the EBITDA by the net sales for each year:\n  - FY2018 EBITDA margin = ($30,966 / $495,761) * 100 = 6.2%\n  - FY2019 EBITDA margin = ($32,635 / $510,329) * 100 = 6.4%\n  - FY2020 EBITDA margin = ($31,555 / $519,926) * 100 = 6.1%\n- Next, we calculate the average of the three EBITDA margins:\n  - Average EBITDA margin = (6.2% + 6.4% + 6.1%) / 3 = 6.23%\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\n\\boxed{6.2%}", "extracted_answer": "6.2%", "is_correct": 1, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Correct Answer**: The correct answer is 6.2% for the FY2018 - FY2020 3-year average unadjusted EBITDA % margin for Walmart.\n\n2. **Proposed Solution**: The proposed solution also states 6.2%.\n\n3. **Comparison**: The proposed solution's final conclusion (6.2%) aligns perfectly with the correct answer (6.2%).\n\nSince the proposed solution reaches the same conclusion as the correct answer, we can determine that the proposed solution is correct.\n\n### Step 2: Output Final Judgement\n\nThe proposed solution aligns with the correct answer, so the final judgement is:\n\n\\boxed{Correct}"}
