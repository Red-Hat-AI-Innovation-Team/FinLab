The formula for the quick ratio is: (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities. Since we are given the figures for current assets, non-current assets, and current liabilities, we can calculate the current assets excluding inventory.\n\nIn FY2022, current assets were $5,853 million, and in FY2023, they were $5,308 million. Inventory in FY2022 was $1,114 million (raw materials and supplies) + $1,325 million (work in process and finished goods), which equals $2,439 million. Inventory in FY2023 was $992 million + $1,221 million, which equals $2,213 million. We can calculate the current assets excluding inventory as follows:\n- FY2022: $5,853 million - $2,439 million = $3,414 million\n- FY2023: $5,308 million - $2,213 million = $3,095 million\n\nNow we can calculate the quick ratio:\n- FY2022: $3,414 million / $5,103 million = 0.669\n- FY2023: $3,095 million / $4,476 million = 0.692\n\nSince 0.692 is greater than 0.669, the quick ratio has improved between FY2023 and FY2022.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\n\\boxed{Improved}", "extracted_answer": "Improved", "is_correct": 1, "evaluation_judgement": "[Step 1] Analyze the Proposed Solution using the correct answer as a reference.\n\nThe correct answer states that the quick ratio has improved from 0.67 times to 0.69 times between FY 2023 and FY 2022, which is a 3.4% increase.

Operating margin is a financial metric calculated by dividing operating income by revenue. However, the context only provides operating income for 2022 and 2021, without providing the revenue figures. Without the revenue figures, we cannot calculate the operating margin directly.\n\nHowever, we can infer that the decrease in operating income was primarily driven by a specific factor mentioned.

The operating margin is calculated by dividing the operating income (pretax income) by total revenues.

The change in inventory is $2,438 - $2,320 = $118 million.\nTo find the average accounts payable, we add FY2019 accounts payable and FY2020 accounts payable and then divide by 2. The average accounts payable is ($1,587 + $1,174) / 2 = $1,380.5 million.\nTo find the DPO, we use the DPO formula: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2019 and FY2020) / (FY2020 COGS + change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020).\nThe DPO is 365 * ($1,380.5 / ($7,772 + $118)).\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\nFirst, we add COGS and the change in inventory: $7,772 + $118 = $7,890.\nNext, we divide the average accounts payable by the sum of COGS and the change in inventory: $1,380.5 / $7,890 = 0.175.\nThen, we multiply the result by 365: 0.175 * 365 = 63.625.\nRounding this to two decimal places gives us 63.63.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{63.63}$", "extracted_answer": "63.63", "is_correct": 0, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution\n\n1. **Correct Answer:** 63.86\n2. **Proposed Solution:** 63.63\n\nThe question specifies rounding the answer to two decimal places.

The quick ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of current assets (excluding inventory) by the current liabilities.\n\nQuick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities\n\nGiven that current assets are $37,857 million and inventory is $2,388 million, we can calculate the quick assets as follows:\n\nQuick Assets = Current Assets - Inventory\nQuick Assets = $37,857 million - $2,388 million\nQuick Assets = $35,469 million\n\nNow, we can calculate the quick ratio by dividing the quick assets by the current liabilities:\n\nQuick Ratio = Quick Assets / Current Liabilities\nQuick Ratio = $35,469 million / $50,171 million\nQuick Ratio \u2248 0.708\n\nA general rule of thumb is that a quick ratio of 1 or higher is considered healthy, as it indicates that the company has sufficient liquid assets to cover its current liabilities.\n\n## Step 3: Final answer\n\\boxed{No, Verizon does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022, since the quick ratio is approximately 0.708, which is lower than 1.}", "extracted_answer": "No, Verizon does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for FY 2022, since the quick ratio is approximately 0.708, which is lower than 1.", "is_correct": 0.5, "evaluation_judgement": "To evaluate the proposed solution, let's follow the steps outlined:\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the Proposed Solution using the correct answer as a reference.**\n\n- **Correct Answer:** The quick ratio for Verizon was approximately 0.54, indicating that Verizon does not have a healthy liquidity profile.\n- **Proposed Solution:** The quick ratio is approximately 0.708, which is lower than 1, and concludes that Verizon does not have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile.\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n- The correct answer states the quick ratio is approximately 0.54.\n- The proposed solution states the quick ratio is approximately 0.708.\n\nThe proposed solution provides a different quick ratio value (0.708) compared to the correct answer (0.54).
